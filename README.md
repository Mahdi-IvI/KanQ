projects with others or who need to report their progress to their team or manager.

To authenticate users, KanQ uses Google sign-in, which makes it easy for users to log in using their
Google account. This feature ensures that your data is secure and protected. The app uses Firebase
as its database, which is a reliable and secure cloud-based database that ensures your data is
always safe and accessible.
